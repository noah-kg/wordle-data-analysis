# Wordle Data Analysis

My take on a (hopefully) in-depth analysis of Wordle. In this project I hope to shed some light and gain some insight into the inner-workings of the viral game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

Goals for this project:
* Try to create a web scraper than can automatically extract the word sets.
* Get a better understanding of the letter distributions for the answer/guess word sets.
* Create appealing visualizations to help understand the data
