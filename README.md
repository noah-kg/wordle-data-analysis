# Wordle Data Analysis

My take on a (hopefully) in-depth analysis of Wordle. In this project I hope to shed some light and gain some insight into the inner-workings of the viral game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). In this project I demonstrate my skills and knowledge of data exploration, filtering, and analysis along with pairing that information with relative, aesthetic visualizations. I aim to dig deep with this project, and I will no doubt spend a lot of time doing my own research and experimentation to make sure I understand the concepts. I hope you find this to be as exciting and interesting as I have!

## Goals for this project:
* Try to create a web scraper than can automatically extract the word sets
* Get a better understanding of the letter distributions for the answer/guess word sets
* Try to find any insight or correlation between letters and their position
* Create appealing visualizations to help understand the data
* Get a better understanding of information and entropy

## My outline for this project is as follows:
1. Data Analysis
    - Letter distributions
    - Letter & position distributions
    - Letter probabilities & correlations
2. Understanding Information & Entropy
    - Visualize distribution of probabilities
    - Gaining basic understanding of both information and entropy
3. Further Analysis
    - Incorporating word frequencies into the mix
    - Comparing the effect on entropy with & without weights
4. Most Common Words?
    - Identify which words in the Wordle set have the highest frequency
5. Most Common First& Second Letter Combinations
    - Find out the most common first letter, and the most common following letter
    - Create a new visualization to make it easier to interpret
6. Goal Review & Conclusion
    - Go through checklist of goals and see what was accomplished
7. Further Steps
    - Any other objectives to add on to make this project more interesting

This project was heavily inspired by [3Blue1Brown's](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) excellent [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&t=1529s) video on Wordle. I wanted to do my own analysis to 1) see if I could reach the same conclusions on my own and 2) see if I could find anything new or interesting about it.
